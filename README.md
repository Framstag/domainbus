# About

This is a small side project for funfold that explores how to efficiently
poll events from task/job tables and either process them or even
copy them over to new tables or place them into Kafka topics or whatever.

In fact this is a protypical implementation for the OUTBOX pattern.
See [microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html)

This is a prototype and not finished.
